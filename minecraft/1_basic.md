# Basic Start #

## Start Minecraft ##

1. Click the left hand corner
2. Click `games`
3. Click `Minecraft Pi`

Play around. Keys:

* `w` Move the player forward
* `a` Move the player left
* `s` Move the player backwards
* `d` Move the player right
* `mouse` Change the player direction/camera angle tab Release the mouse
* `right` click Place block
* `left` click Smash block
* `scroll` wheel Change selected block
* `space` Jump (fly higher when flying)
* `double tap space` Fly (double tap again to stop flying)
* `shift` Crouch (fly lower when flying)
* `e` Block selection menu
* `1â€“8` Change block selection from inventory
* `esc` Open the options menu (also releases mouse)

Test all these keys to make sure they work.

Resize the window by using `tab` to about half the screen, on the right side.

Remember to get out using `tab`, or `alt-tab`. If you can't look around in minecraft, make sure to click on the mouse.

## Start programming Python ##

### Make a new program ###

* Explain what folders and files are, as simple as possible
* Open `File Manager` (3rd icon to the right on top)
* Create a new folder called `Minecraft (name)` in `/home/pi/Documents` by right clicking, select `Create New`.
* Open `IDLE`. Click the berry, then `Programming`, then `Python 2 (IDLE)`
* Create a new file in IDLE, then save it as `hello.py`

### Basic Python ###

Enter code to print something:

```python
print "hello world"
```

Push `F5` to run the program. When asked to save, click `OK` or hit `enter` key.

`print` is a function. It does something for us. In this case, prints to a window called "python shell".

Print multiple things:

```python
name = "Simon"
print "hello world", name
```

More complicated:

```python
name = "Simon
age = 39
print "hello world", name, "my age is", age
```

Comments:

```python
# this line gets ignored. this helps us explain what our program does.
print "hello world"
```

The computer is dumb. Try getting rid of a `"` in a print line, and run the program. See what happens.

Close this file when done.

## Hello world in Minecraft ##

We will learn how to write a program that talks to minecraft. We do this by printing "hello world" to minecraft instead of python shell.

Make a new file in IDLE called `hello_minecraft.py`.

```python
# connects our program to minecraft
import mcpi.minecraft as minecraft
mc = minecraft.Minecraft.create()

# print
mc.postToChat("Hello world")
```

We just wrote a program that can talk to minecraft.

## Teleport ##

Make a new file called `teleport.py`

```python
# connects our program to minecraft
import mcpi.minecraft as minecraft
mc = minecraft.Minecraft.create()

# get our position
pos = mc.player.getTilePos()

print pos.x, pos.y, pos.z
print pos
```

Explain coordinate system. X and Z is the flat land. Y is your height.

Let's teleport. Add this line to the bottom of your program:

```python
# teleports us to x = 10, y = 11, z = 12
mc.player.setTilePos(10, 11, 12)
```

Your position is 0.5 off because your head is in the middle of the block.

You can also use variables.

```python
x = 10
y = 11
z = 12

mc.player.setTilePos(x, y, z)
```

Change x, y, z to whatever you want. The number has to be within -127, 127 because minecraft pi world is small. Try positive and negative numbers. Explain how to express ranges using `()` and `[]`.

You can also use arithmetic.

```python
x = 10
y = 11
z = 12

# adding 5 to teleport x coordinate
mc.player.setTilePos(x + 5, y, z)
```

In this case, x doesn't change. How do you prove it didn't change?

Exercise: teleport to your current position, but forward in x by 10. Hint: you can't just use a number. You have to use your current position to start.

Close this file when done.

## Precise teleport ##

Make a new file called "precise_teleport.py".

```python
# connects our program to minecraft
import mcpi.minecraft as minecraft
mc = minecraft.Minecraft.create()

pos = mc.player.getPos()
print pos
```

What's the difference between getPos() and getTilePos()? If unsure, input the line and compare.

```python
tilePos = mc.player.getTilePos()
print tilePos
```

Difference is decimal vs. whole numbers. Explain the difference, if the concept.

Try to teleport again, but this time precisely:

```python
x = 10.2
y = 11.7
z = 12.3

mc.player.setPos(x, y, z)
```

Change the position slightly (a small decimal value) and see what happens.

## Add a block ##

We can write a program to add a block for us.

We need to give it the position of the block and the block type.

```python
# connects our program to minecraft
import mcpi.minecraft as minecraft
mc = minecraft.Minecraft.create()

# x, y, z, then block type. 1 is stone.
# use coordinates near you, from the screen, so you can see the new block
mc.setBlock(10, 11, 12, 1)
```

This is a list of the block types.

Activity: Add a block next to you. Remember how to find where you are. Once you've added one, pick another block type and see if the block changes.

You can also get them list from Python.

```python
# get block list
from mcpi import block

# use the ID from the block list. look at the name, it matches the list.
mc.setBlock(10, 10, 10, block.STONE.id)
```

Activity: Add 10 blocks in a row. Use the ID list.

```python
# advanced! optional, to show how we can do this very quickly
for i in range(0, 20):
  mc.setBlock(10, 10 + i, 10, block.STONE.id)
```

You can also make a cube of blocks.

```python
# x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, type
mc.setBlocks(10, 10, 10, 15, 15, 15, 1)
```

Try changing these numbers, and make different sorts of rectangular blocks.

So now you've added a lot of these blocks. How do we erase them? (hint: what does "empty space" have?)
