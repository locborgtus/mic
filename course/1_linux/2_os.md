# Operating System basics #

* What does an Operating System (OS) do?
  * OS manages hardware and applications
  * user <> application <> OS <> hardware
  * For example, the OS manages hardware like:
    * micro SD card
    * the display (HDMI)
    * keyboard and mouse
    * network (WiFi or Ethernet)
  * it also does security, to prevent unauthorized ppl from using the system

* regular user vs. super user
  * try making a file in your home folder (/home/rpi)
  * now try making a file in /, or /bin, or /usr/bin (you can't)
  * those are protected folders, meant to protect against bad people and yourself
  * (why yourself?)
