# Strings #

Strings are array of chars. 

At the end of the string, there is a end-of-string marker of the integer value 0.

Use double quotes to contain strings. Example:

```c
"hello world"
```

If you want to use certain reserved characters (like the double quote), use a backslash to "escape" the character:

```c
"hello \"world\""
```
